This project implements a classic problem in game theory, the Prisonor's Dilemma, into a simulation that can be played. 
The Prinsor's Dilemma is a problem that deals with the conflict of mutual cooperation or self-interest. If a prisonor were
to cooperate, and the other were to defect, the defected prisonor will receive a light punishment. If both cooperate, then they
each receieve a lighter sentence. If they both defect, then the punishment is severe on both. In the program implementation,
the punishment or reward will be conducted as points. There are several strategies that have been implemented with the use of
object-oriented programming and algorithms. For example, the Friedman strategy, a strategy in which the first prisonor will always
cooperate unless the second prisonors defects, which in that case, the first prisoner will defect for the rest of the game.
The program implements two-hundred rounds to give a better picture of how points are manipulated.
